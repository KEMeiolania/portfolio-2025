# Portfolio 2025: Urban Analytics & Interactive Prototypes

> **Technical Note on Data & Architecture:**
>
> This repository houses the **frontend visualization layer** of my research portfolio.
>
> To ensure optimal rendering performance and browser compatibility, complex spatial econometric calculations (including the **Spatial Durbin Model** and **Graph Theory metrics** mentioned in the research scope) were performed **offline** using Python (PySAL/NetworkX).
>
> This visualization utilizes pre-computed parameters derived from actual empirical datasets. This approach ensures real-time performance, allowing for the interactive demonstration of algorithmic logic and policy scenarios without the latency of server-side statistical computing.
